                    childhood memories are the most important parts of my life. Specifically, also I have some good memories of childhood. </p>

                <h3>My Adulthood</h3>
                <p>Young adults also enjoy clear sensory abilities, strength and stamina. In their young age, they have clear vision and response to sound unlike their older counterparts. 
                    The older they get, visual clarity reduces and adjustments to various intensities of light become a challenge. 
                    Ideally, persons in their old age receive only a third of the light that young adults receive in their retina.</p>
